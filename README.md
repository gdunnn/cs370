- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The goal of the project was to try and have our intelligent pirate agent solve the maze by only using four directions (left, right, up, down). I was given the environment, replay, build, and game code, and was left to create the Q-training algorithm code that would train our agent well enough to complete the maze.

- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

On computers, computer scientists create tools, widgets, and apps. Some people specialize in data science and create reports, like how a full stack developer would handle, evaluate, and display data. Some people specialize in systems, such as database administrators and system administrators, and their job entails setting and enabling systems to communicate with one another. Finally, there are software developers who construct apps from the ground up, such as app developers, programmers, testers, and other software developers.

- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I take a piecemeal approach to problem resolution. I consider what tools I'll need to complete a task and begin there. Documenting the list of tools, you'll need to tackle an issue and then building upon it until you reach completion strikes me as excellent work. In addition, I believe it is critical to address issues one at a time.

- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

A huge responsibility we take on as computer scientists is to make sure that not only our organization's integrity remains uncompromised, but more importantly our end user's integrity remains uncompromised. It is of vital importance that we do our best to maintain this integrity. Failure to do so could result in loss of revenue, lawsuits. and negative media attention.
